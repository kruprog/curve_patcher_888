Curve shapes were developed specially for every sensor type.

To patch your file, please uncomment lines with filename you working with, and comment lines with other filenames.

This script overwrites your file!!!
Offsets hardcoded in this script are correct only for files with sizes exactly as specified in comments.
Files sizes and offsets depends on ROM version. I used files from the newest ROM.
